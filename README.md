# SMS Managament Application API
Create an SMS management API using the framework of your choice that will model the following abstractions:

## SMS:

- person sending sms
- person receiving sms
- message of sms
- sms status

## Contact:

- name of person
- phone number of person

## Relationship Needed:

- All sms sent by a Contact should be linked to them
- All sms sent to a Contact should be linked to them
- Deleting a contact removes the messages they sent and references to messages they received.
